# The Local Food Project

Week 1: Impact Opportunity

Scope of problem.

Agriculture practices throughout the world are plagued with many challenges that are causing consumers to grow suspicious of their food. Because of this, there is an ever growing demand for auditability in supply chains. This is where the Local Food Project comes in. Our goal is to leverage blockchain technology to bring traceability to an industry in dire need of it. Besides allowing us to track important data points, a blockchain based network along with web3 give us the ability to connect consumers directly to producers, cutting out money hungry middlemen. 

It’s common that farmers don’t receive their fair share of profit, even though they are the most important part of the supply chain. On the consumer end, we’re not really sure where our food is sourced from, or more importantly, how it was sourced. If only we could see metrics such as how many hands it passed in getting to us, how much energy was used in the process, or how organic the produce is. With all of this information handy, consumers would be empowered to directly support farmers globally.  Consumers tend to buy products from companies committed to social good, and in turn could use our application to easily buy produce from farmers using the best practices.2 Current community supported agriculture practices are broken, and moving to an Ethereum based system will solve the problems we face. 

Why blockchain?

“Blockchain has so far been most useful in the agriculture sector in terms of understanding the source and journey of produce. This is vital for both farmers and consumers: it allows farmers to negotiate better prices throughout the supply chain, while giving consumers confidence in the knowledge of exactly where produce they buy comes from. This is key aspect when considering the growing lack of trust in the sourcing of produce sold in markets.”

Blockchain technology works well because of how it empowers the network’s users to be in control of their data. Bitcoin was the first implementation of this new technology, giving users the ability to easily exchange value within protocol as cryptoassets. Ethereum builds on top of this concept by allowing for the easy development of decentralized applications, where contracts are deemed smart because they are ruled by code. This gives accountability to the applications built on the network, allowing the rules of the concept to be completely auditable. This tool lets us share important supply chain metrics between consumer and producer alike, with the ability almost immediately exchange value for the tracked produce. By simplifying the supply chain, we allow users anywhere to benefit local economies globally. 
What is the size of the market? What demographics will you serve? Which industries will you impact? Any concurrent trends?

Specifically within the US, Agriculture consisted of 5.5% of our Gross Domestic Product and the output of America's farms contributed $136.7 billion of this sum. Because these decentralized applications and the internet are not limited by borders, users in any country (aside from technological barriers) will be able to opt in to use this system. Many other countries agricultural industries account for significantly more of their GDP than the United States. The Indian food processing industry accounts for 32 per cent of the country's total food market, one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export and expected growth. In Peru, agriculture represents 13 percent of GDP but employs 30 percent of the country's population.
	
The technological barrier is the what’s slowing down the universal adoption of these systems. Besides that, there is no bias within, not one person or another to potentially be excluded from participating in this newly accessible global economy. We must make these networks friendly to the user, and simplify the ability for many to utilize cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Ethereum and web3 are making significant progress in this regard, and the general masses are beginning to understand why they can trust these networks as a payment method. 

Rural farmers will now have the ability to sell to consumers across the globe. This will lead to a “fairer distribution of goods and currency amongst some of the poorest regions of the world, as well as increase community-based agricultural models on a global scale.”3

What are some current solutions to the problem you identified? Do they work effectively?

Community supported agriculture (CSA) is a partnership between farmers and consumers in which the responsibilities, risks and rewards of farming are shared. Despite being the most effective system to date, from speaking to farmers in Colorado and India, we now know that the concept of community supported agriculture is very broken. One farm owner said customers want the products but are not willing to go very far out of their way to get them. He said while they’ve been great in the past, use of these systems is heavily declining, and not much is being done to help small farms be competitive. 

The problem with this model is that the trust has been lost. Our project, the Local Farm Project, is working on bringing it back. The future is in Ethereum supported agriculture. By bringing back transparency in our supply chain, while creating a trustless platform for exchange between consumer and farmer, we can solve the issues plaguing current local agriculture methods.

Who are the stakeholders involved? How are they thinking/feeling/acting currently?

The current stakeholders are primary small scale farmers, growers, producers, and local consumers. Secondary to these would be food processors, aggregators, distributors, and the relevant service providers. But really, because everyone eats, “any issue relating to agriculture ultimately affects a large and scattered range of consumers”. Just the same, everyone in the world would be benefiting from this upgraded system. 

From the farmers I spoke to, they seemed to agree that while the current model is broken, we’d be best served by moving to a completely new one. The concept of supporting their livelihood through web3 and cryptocurrencies feels like a foreign concept, but they recognized its importance and would learn new tools to keep them financially afloat- just like farmers have been doing for all of history prior. 
What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?

The biggest added complexity will be from the technological barrier. Currently only 54% of the world’s population has access to internet. Stifling the ability for this to go mainstream even more is the fact that the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a whole globally is still less than 2%. While that metric may seem worrisome, this is analogous to the amount of email users in 1994. For global adoption to take place, we have to assist in the accessibility of technology and the internet for people all over the world.

For now, we’d have to make it easy for a farmer to opt in to this model. Doing so would require an easy onboarding process, along with an automatic way for cryptoassets to be exchanged for said farmers local currency. It’d be important to educate users on the advantages of retaining some savings in the form of crypto, while at the same time giving them the option to do as they please.
